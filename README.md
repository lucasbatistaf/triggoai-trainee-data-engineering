# Part 3:

## Solving Business Problems

- Solving Business Problems
    - Retention analysis of recurring customers (one or more orders in the analysis period) and which insights could we extract
    - Late delivery prediction analysis:
        - Define what a late delivery is.
        - Use relevant fields to create the features for the model
        - Divide train and test datasets
        - Implement the prediction analisys using Random Forest Classifier
        - Evaluate the model performance and explain the results
    - Customer Segmentation: 
        - Segment the customers in groups
        - Do a behavior analysis  of each group and suggest marketing strategies for each one.
    - Customer Satisfaction:
